# Screensaver_as_wallpaper
This short AppleScript allows macOS user to use an animated screensaver in lieu of their desktop image.

In particular, combined with SaveHollywood (http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/SaveHollywood/about.html), it allows you to play any video on your desktop, or combined with Aerial (https://github.com/JohnCoates/Aerial), it allows you to play Apple's gorgeous aerial movies.

To use this AppleScript :
- open it with Apple's script editor (often the default editor for this type of file)
- click File > Export and select "Application" as filetype, then Save
- the application bundle has been created and saved ! Enjoy :)

You can also set your Mac to execute it automatically on boot :
- go to System Preferences > Users > your account
- in login items, add the application bundle
